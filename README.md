If you like what you see, simply download the html and start using it yourself. There are various mechanisms by which you can save your notes so that they persist. In the brain cloud go to the control panel > Saving. I use GitHub saver as this allows easy version control, but other great options exist as well.

Here is a bare template brain cloud that I suggest using, as it does not have any existing notes yet.

## What is brain cloud based on?
It is a tuned web-notebook that is based on an open source project called [TiddlyWiki](https://github.com/Jermolene/TiddlyWiki5). Here's their description:

* TiddlyWiki is a complete interactive wiki in JavaScript. It can be used as a single HTML file in the browser or as a powerful Node.js application. It is highly customisable: the entire user interface is itself implemented in hackable WikiText.

So where does brain cloud fit into this? It represents the completed product of a LOT of hours customizing and tweaking a vanilla flavored TiddlyWiki with a focus on presenting an interface that is tuned for highly productive note taking. 

Put another way, it aims to save you the all work by delivering a ready-to-go system so you can spend less time tweaking and more time learning!
